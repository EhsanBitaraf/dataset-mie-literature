\section{Introduction}
In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the role of high-quality, diverse datasets cannot be overstated. These datasets serve as the foundation upon which AI models are built, trained, and refined, ultimately shaping the capabilities and performance of AI systems across various domains \cite{dataset1,dataset2}. The medical field, in particular, stands to benefit immensely from the application of AI, with potential improvements in diagnosis, treatment planning, and healthcare management \cite{medical1}.

The Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) Conference, a cornerstone event in the field of medical informatics, generates a wealth of valuable scientific content annually. However, the sheer volume of articles presented at such conferences poses a significant challenge for researchers and practitioners attempting to extract meaningful insights and identify emerging trends \cite{mie1}. This challenge underscores the need for sophisticated tools and methodologies to analyze and synthesize large volumes of scientific literature effectively \cite{tools1}.

In response to this need, we present a novel dataset derived from the MIE Conference proceedings, processed using advanced techniques such as topic extraction and affiliation mining. This dataset not only exemplifies the power of open-source data in driving scientific progress but also demonstrates the potential of intelligent tools in managing and analyzing vast amounts of scientific information.

By making datasets freely available to the research community, we foster collaboration, encourage reproducibility, and accelerate the pace of innovation \cite{opensci1}. Open-source datasets democratize access to valuable information, enabling researchers from diverse backgrounds to contribute to the advancement of AI and its applications in fields like medical informatics \cite{opensci2}.

Furthermore, the application of smart tools for analyzing scientific articles across various disciplines has become increasingly crucial. As the volume of published research continues to grow exponentially, traditional manual methods of literature review and synthesis become increasingly untenable \cite{tools2}. Advanced techniques such as natural language processing, machine learning, and data mining offer powerful means to extract key insights, identify patterns, and uncover hidden relationships within large corpora of scientific literature \cite{tools2}.

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of our dataset preparation process. It details the methodologies employed in topic extraction and affiliation mining. By providing this dataset and elaborating our approach, we aim to contribute to the broader scientific community's efforts in leveraging AI for knowledge discovery and synthesis in the field of medical informatics.

\section{Methodology}
In this study, we employed a structured and multi-stage approach to collect, process, and prepare a comprehensive dataset of articles from the Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) Conference. The primary tool used for this process was the Triple-A software \cite{triplea}, which facilitated data retrieval and preprocessing. This section outlines the various steps involved in constructing the dataset, including metadata acquisition, affiliation mining, and topic extraction.

\subsection{Data Acquisition}
We began by sourcing the metadata for the articles from the PubMed database, utilizing the Triple-A tool to streamline the extraction process. Our initial query targeted all publications within the journal series "Studies in Health Technology and Informatics" (Stud Health Technol Inform), which regularly publishes MIE conference proceedings. This ensured we captured a wide range of articles, from which we could later refine the dataset. 

To focus specifically on MIE conference papers, we filtered out irrelevant volumes that did not correspond to MIE-related events. This step ensured that the dataset was centered around contributions presented at the MIE Conference, maintaining a consistent scope for further analysis.

\subsection{Affiliation Mining}

[WARNING: It should be explained more about what affiliation mining is and then reference should be made to the tools that were used.]

Once the relevant articles were identified, we conducted a detailed analysis of the affiliation metadata. For this task, we implemented a fast and efficient parser designed for MEDLINE and PubMed Open Access data, which enabled us to extract key elements from the affiliation strings. This process allowed us to systematically retrieve multiple fields, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Department
\item Affiliation (institution)
\item Location
\item Country
\item Email address
\item Zip code
\end{itemize}

Additionally, we utilized an affiliation-matching function that cross-referenced the extracted affiliation data with the Global Research Identifier Database (GRID) \cite{grid}. This step improved the consistency and accuracy of the institutional affiliations, ensuring that the dataset was robust for further institutional and geographic analysis.

\subsection{Topic Extraction}
For topic extraction, we applied the TextRank algorithm \cite{textrank}, a graph-based natural language processing (NLP) technique well-suited for unsupervised keyword and sentence extraction. TextRank operates by constructing a graph where the nodes represent words or sentences, and edges represent relationships between them based on co-occurrence. By identifying the most important nodes in this graph, TextRank effectively extracts key topics without the need for labeled training data. This algorithm was particularly beneficial for our dataset as it allowed us to extract relevant topics from articles spanning various languages and medical informatics domains, making the method adaptable and scalable across different contexts.

\subsection{Data Output and Formatting}
The final dataset was prepared in multiple formats to maximize usability and accessibility for a broad range of users. The primary output was structured in JSON format, allowing for flexibility in data handling and compatibility with various applications. In addition, a CSV version of the dataset was generated to ensure ease of use for researchers and practitioners who may prefer more traditional tabular formats. This dual-format approach ensures that the dataset can be easily integrated into a variety of workflows, enhancing its utility for downstream analysis.
